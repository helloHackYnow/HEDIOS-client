# Hedios client

This is a small cpp client I'm writing for the [Hedios protocol](https://github.com/helloHackYnow/HEDIOS.git). For the moment, it is only compatible with the Alchitry Au v2 board, but this supported can easely be extended.

## Disclaimer 

This repo is the result of a bit less than a week of work. I am aware of the incompleteness of this client, but it's still in is infant stage.

I will happily accept any form of suggestion to this project, on which I can only work on my spare time.
